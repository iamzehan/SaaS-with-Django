## Detailed Timeline

- **Conceptualization of the SaaS Foundations Course:** The course creator envisions a project where developers can build a SaaS application to potentially generate monthly recurring revenue from code written in a weekend. The goal is to teach the foundations of building and scaling such an application.
- **Course Technology Stack Selection:** The creator chooses a modern technology stack including Django (Python web framework), Stripe (payment processing), Neon (PostgreSQL database), TailwindCSS (CSS framework), Flowbite (TailwindCSS components), and GitHub Actions (CI/CD). Python is the core language.
- **Project Setup - Local Development:**A project folder named "SAS" (or "SAS foundations") is created.
- The workspace is saved in VS Code.
- An "SRC" folder is created within the project to house the Django code.
- A requirements.txt file is created to specify Python package dependencies, initially listing Django with a version constraint (>=5.0, <=5.2).
- A Python virtual environment is created using python3 -m venv venv and activated.
- The requirements.txt file is installed using pip install -r requirements.txt.
- Pip is potentially upgraded for best practices.
- **Creating the Django Project:**The developer navigates into the "SRC" folder (cd SRC).
- The Django project is initiated using django-admin startproject CFEhome .. This creates the project files directly within the "SRC" folder.
- **Initial Django Run:**The developer runs the development server using python manage.py runserver.
- The default Django "Hello World" landing page is observed in the browser.
- **Setting up Basic Views and URLs:**A views.py file is created within the "CFEhome" project (or potentially an app later, though initially shown within the project).
- A basic view function (e.g., homepage_view) is created to return an HTTP response.
- A urls.py file is created or modified within the "CFEhome" project to define URL patterns.
- A URL path (e.g., "hello-world/") is routed to the created view function.
- **Configuring Templates:**A "templates" folder is created at the project root level.
- The DIRS setting in settings.py is configured to point to the "templates" folder, allowing Django to find templates there.
- A basic HTML template (e.g., home.html) is created within the "templates" folder.
- The view function is modified to render this template using render.
- **Implementing Template Inheritance and Includes:**A base.html template is created to define a base structure for pages.
- Templates can now extend from base.html to inherit its structure and define content within blocks.
- Smaller template snippets (e.g., snippets/welcome_user_msg.html) are created and included in other templates using the {% include ... %} tag.
- Basic template logic like conditional statements ({% if user.is_authenticated %}) is demonstrated.
- **Setting up Git Version Control:**A Git repository is initialized in the project root.
- A .gitignore file is created and configured to ignore the virtual environment (venv/) and other standard Python/Mac files.
- Files are added to the staging area (git add --all).
- An initial commit is made with a descriptive message (git commit -m "Hello World MSG").
- A new private repository is created on GitHub (e.g., "sess-and-R&D-sample" or "SAS-foundations").
- The local Git repository is linked to the remote GitHub repository (git remote add origin ...).
- The initial commit is pushed to GitHub (git push origin main).
- **Preparing for Deployment with Docker and Railway:**Docker is introduced as the containerization technology.
- Railway is chosen as the deployment platform, which simplifies Docker usage.
- A Dockerfile and Railway.toml configuration file are created to define the application's container and deployment settings on Railway.
- Watch patterns are defined in Railway.toml to trigger builds when specific files (source code, requirements) change.
- Changes are committed and pushed to GitHub, preparing for Railway deployment.
- **Deploying to Railway:**An account is created on Railway, often by authenticating with GitHub.
- A new project is created on Railway and linked to the GitHub repository containing the Django project.
- Railway automatically builds and deploys the application based on the Dockerfile and Railway.toml.
- The ephemeral nature of Docker containers and the implications for databases (default SQLite being destroyed on redeployment) are highlighted.
- **Configuring Environment Variables:**The importance of using environment variables for settings like DEBUG and SECRET_KEY is explained, especially for production.
- Initial environment variable handling is shown using Python's os.environ.get(), demonstrating how to cast values and provide defaults.
- The python-decouple library is introduced and added to requirements.txt as a more robust way to manage environment variables from a .env file.
- The settings.py is updated to use config() from python-decouple to load settings.
- The concept of exporting environment variables in the terminal is shown as a temporary local solution.
- **Setting up a Production Database with Neon:**Neon is introduced as a serverless PostgreSQL database specifically recommended for its branching feature.
- The process of creating a database in Neon is described, including potentially changing the database name and adding roles.
- The connection string provided by Neon is highlighted as the key to connecting the Django application.
- **Structuring Static Files:**The concept of static files (CSS, JavaScript, images) in Django is explained.
- A "static-files" folder is created at the project root.
- Subfolders (e.g., "vendors") are created within "static-files" to organize external libraries.
- External CSS and JavaScript files (like Flowbite) are manually downloaded and placed in the "static-files/vendors" folder.
- The "vendors" folder within "static-files" is added to .gitignore to avoid committing large vendor files.
- The STATICFILES_DIRS setting in settings.py is configured to point to the "static-files" directory.
- The STATIC_ROOT setting is configured to define where static files will be collected for deployment (e.g., "local-cdn").
- The local-cdn directory is also added to .gitignore.
- **Implementing a Custom Management Command for Vendor Static Files:**A "management/commands" structure is created within a Django app (e.g., a new commando app, which is later integrated into profiles).
- A new custom command file (e.g., vendor_pole.py) is created.
- The command is designed to download vendor static files from specified URLs using the requests library.
- A helper module (helpers/downloader.py) is created with a download_to_local function using requests and pathlib.
- The custom command utilizes the helper function to download the vendor files to the configured STATICFILES_DIRS.
- The custom command is added to the Dockerfile's build process to automate the download during deployment.
- **Configuring Email Sending with Gmail:**The need for transactional email (e.g., for user verification) is explained.
- Gmail is chosen as a temporary solution for testing and local development.
- The process of setting up two-factor authentication and generating an App Password in Google Account security settings is outlined.
- Django's email backend settings (EMAIL_BACKEND, EMAIL_HOST, EMAIL_PORT, EMAIL_USE_TLS, EMAIL_HOST_USER, EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD) are configured in settings.py, likely using environment variables or python-decouple.
- The Django sendtestemail management command is used to verify the email configuration.
- The ADMINS and MANAGERS settings are configured to receive email notifications for server errors.
- **Implementing User Authentication and Allauth:**Django's built-in user authentication system is leveraged.
- The django-allauth package is introduced and added to requirements.txt for more comprehensive authentication features (registration, email confirmation, social login).
- django-allauth is added to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py.
- Allauth-specific settings (like ACCOUNT_AUTHENTICATION_METHOD, ACCOUNT_EMAIL_VERIFICATION, LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL, LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL) are configured.
- Allauth's URL patterns are included in the main urls.py.
- Database migrations are run (python manage.py migrate) to create Allauth's models.
- The Allauth-provided views and templates for login, registration, etc., become available.
- Social authentication (specifically GitHub) is mentioned as a feature of Allauth.
- **Exploring Django Admin and User Management:**The Django admin interface is used to manage users and permissions.
- Creating a superuser (python manage.py createsuperuser) is demonstrated.
- Accessing and viewing user data in the admin is shown.
- The User model and its methods (like has_perm, groups.all()) are explored in the Django shell.
- **Implementing User Permissions and Groups:**Django's built-in permission system is introduced.
- Permissions are initially explored and managed through the Django admin, demonstrating granting staff status and object-level permissions (view, change users).
- The potential risks of granting excessive permissions in the admin are highlighted.
- The concept of creating custom permissions is mentioned for a more fine-grained approach.
- User groups are introduced as a way to assign permissions to multiple users.
- Groups are created in the Django admin (e.g., "view users", "basic plan", "pro plan").
- Users are added to groups in the admin.
- Accessing user groups programmatically (user.groups.all()) is shown.
- Changing view behavior based on a user's group membership is demonstrated.
- Setting user groups based on a subscription or external logic is explored using Python sets to manage group IDs efficiently.
- **Integrating Stripe for Subscriptions:**Stripe is introduced for handling recurring financial transactions (subscriptions).
- A Stripe account and dashboard are necessary, with a focus on using test mode initially.
- The stripe Python library is added to requirements.txt.
- The Stripe API key is configured, ideally using environment variables and python-decouple.
- A value error is intentionally raised in production if a test key is used, emphasizing the importance of production keys.
- A Django model (UserSubscription or similar) is created to link Django users to Stripe customer IDs.
- A model for SubscriptionPrice or ProductPrice is created to represent Stripe products and prices in the Django application, including details like Stripe ID, recurring interval, and price amount.
- Helper functions are likely developed to interact with the Stripe API (e.g., creating customers, creating checkout sessions).
- Checkout sessions are implemented using Stripe's API to handle the payment flow.
- Stripe webhooks are introduced as a crucial mechanism for receiving real-time updates from Stripe about subscription changes (creation, renewal, cancellation).
- **Handling Subscription Syncing and Status:**A management command (e.g., sync_user_subs) is created to synchronize user subscription statuses with Stripe.
- This command can filter subscriptions based on status (active, trialing) and potentially days left until renewal or days since the period ended.
- A subscription utility function (refresh_user_subscription) is created to update a user's subscription status based on information from Stripe.
- This utility function is used in views (e.g., a profile view or a dedicated webhook view) and the management command.
- The concept of "dangling" subscriptions (subscriptions in Stripe but not reflected in the application) is addressed, and the management command includes logic to identify and handle them.
- **Implementing Timing and Filtering in QuerySets:**Python's datetime and timedelta are used to perform date and time calculations.
- Custom model manager or queryset methods are created to filter subscriptions based on dates (e.g., by_days_left, by_days_ago, by_range) using Django's Q lookups for complex filtering.
- **Using GitHub Actions for CI/CD (Further Configuration):**GitHub Actions workflows are used to automate processes like running tests and database migrations.
- The migrate command is added to a GitHub Actions workflow to ensure the database is updated on deployment or after code changes.
- GitHub Secrets are used to securely store sensitive information like the Django secret key and Stripe API key in the CI/CD environment.
- Generating a secure Django secret key using openssl or Python is demonstrated for use in environment variables or secrets.
