- **views.py:** Files that contain the logic for handling web requests and returning responses in Django.
- **Templates:** HTML files used to render the user interface in Django, often incorporating Django's templating engine for dynamic content.
- **Static Files:** Files that are not dynamically generated, such as CSS, JavaScript, and images. Django provides mechanisms for managing and serving static files.
- **Environment Variables:** Variables that store configuration information outside of the code, often used for sensitive data like API keys or database credentials.
- **python-decouple:** A library for separating settings from code using environment variables or .env files.
- **Django Allauth:** A reusable Django app for handling user authentication, including social authentication (like GitHub).
- **Django Management Commands:** Custom commands that can be executed using python manage.py.
- **User Authentication:** The process of verifying the identity of a user.
- **User Permissions:** The ability to control what actions authenticated users are allowed to perform within the application.
- **User Groups:** A way to categorize users and assign permissions to multiple users simultaneously.
- **Subscriptions:** A model for providing ongoing access to a service in exchange for recurring payments, typically managed through Stripe.
- **Stripe Webhooks:** Automated notifications sent by Stripe to your application when specific events occur (e.g., a subscription is created or cancelled).
- **Django Q Lookup:** A feature in Django's ORM that allows for complex database queries using logical operators like OR.
- **Pathlib:** A built-in Python module for working with file paths.
- **Requests:** A popular Python library for making HTTP requests.

**Core Processes and Workflows:**

- **Project Setup:** Creating a Django project, setting up a virtual environment, installing dependencies (using requirements.txt), and initializing a Git repository.
- **Creating Views and URLs:** Defining functions or classes (views) to handle requests and mapping URLs to these views using urls.py.
- **Templating:** Using Django's templating engine to render dynamic HTML content, including concepts like {% include %} and {% extends %} for code reusability.
- **Managing Static Files:** Configuring Django to find and serve static files, including vendors' files and using collectstatic for production.
- **User Authentication and Management:** Implementing user registration, login, and social authentication using Django's built-in features and Django Allauth.
- **Permissions and Authorization:** Controlling user access to different parts of the application using Django's permission system and user groups.
- **Database Management:** Setting up and configuring a production-ready database like Neon PostgreSQL and performing database migrations.
- **Environment Variable Management:** Using environment variables to configure settings and sensitive information, both locally and in production using tools like python-decouple and GitHub Secrets.
- **Custom Management Commands:** Creating custom manage.py commands to automate specific tasks, such as downloading vendor static files or syncing user subscriptions.
- **Integrating with External Services:** Connecting the Django application to services like Gmail (for emails) and Stripe (for payments).
- **Deployment:** Deploying the application to a platform like Railway using Docker containers and GitHub Actions for automation.
- **Implementing Stripe Subscriptions:** Integrating Stripe to handle recurring payments, creating customers and prices, and managing user subscriptions based on their payment status.
- **Handling Stripe Webhooks:** Setting up webhooks to receive real-time updates from Stripe about subscription events and updating the application's database accordingly.

**Important Considerations:**

- **Security:** Securing sensitive information using environment variables and secrets, being mindful of permissions granted in the Django admin, and understanding the security implications of transactional email services.
- **Scalability:** Designing the application with scalability in mind, leveraging Django's features and choosing appropriate technologies like Neon PostgreSQL.
- **Code Organization:** Following conventions for organizing code (e.g., using views.py, urls.py, templates, static files) and using apps to modularize functionality.
- **Version Control (Git):** Using Git for tracking code changes, collaborating, and deploying the application, including understanding .gitignore to exclude unnecessary files.
- **CI/CD:** Implementing CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions to automate testing, building, and deploying the application.
- **Production Readiness:** Understanding the differences between development and production environments and configuring the application accordingly (e.g., debug mode, static file handling, database).

**Quiz Answer Key:**

1. The requirements.txt file lists all the Python packages and their versions that a project depends on. This allows for easy installation of dependencies on different machines or environments using pip install -r requirements.txt.
2. A virtual environment creates an isolated space for a Python project to manage its dependencies. This prevents conflicts between different projects that might require different versions of the same library.
3. manage.py is a command-line utility that provides various administrative tasks for a Django project, such as running the development server, managing the database (migrations), creating apps, and executing custom commands.
4. Django uses urls.py files to define URL patterns. These patterns are regular expressions that match incoming URLs and route the request to a corresponding view function or class.
5. The collectstatic command gathers all static files from various apps and configured locations into a single directory, making them ready for serving in a production environment.
6. Using environment variables keeps sensitive information separate from the codebase. This is crucial for security as it prevents exposing credentials or API keys in version control and allows for easier management of different settings across environments.
7. Django Allauth provides a comprehensive and easy-to-use solution for user authentication, including registration, login, password reset, email verification, and social authentication with providers like GitHub.
8. A Django management command is a custom script that can be run from the command line using python manage.py <command_name>. It allows developers to automate project-specific tasks.
9. Django user groups allow administrators to assign a set of permissions to a group, and then add users to that group. This simplifies managing permissions for multiple users by applying permissions at the group level rather than individually.
10. Stripe webhooks are automated notifications sent by Stripe to a predefined URL in your application when specific events occur on your Stripe account, such as a successful payment, a subscription renewal, or a failed charge. They are essential for keeping your application's data synchronized with Stripe's data in real-time.
